This project is a class planner for how courses are going! 

The main page allows classes to be added with a button, which pulls up a form.
The form requires course name, current grade, description, difficulty (out of 10, specially constrained to prevent other inputs), and time commitment/week.
After adding, the courses will immediately refresh the list shown at the bottom of the screen, where they have been styled to show the inputted information. The styling also comes with a delete button so a course can immediately be deleted!
